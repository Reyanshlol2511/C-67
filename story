Mrs. Day and Joan visited Paris to finish the paperwork, and went to the famous Hotel, 'The Crillon". 
The Hotel Clerk gave them Room 342.
Mrs. Day was feeling unwell, so she asked Joan to call the Hotel Doctor.
The Doctor arrived after some time, as he was busy with another patient.
He inspected Mrs. Day and he told her that she was fine, however told Joan that she had a severe condition called "Black Death".
He told Joan that she had to get a special medicine, which wasn't available at any local chemist, but his house.
